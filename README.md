# Hello, I'm Jester (Andrew)!

> "We call ourselves Runners. We exist on the edge... between the gloss and the reality... the **Mirror's Edge**.. We keep out of trouble, out of sight, and the cops don't bother us. Runners see the city in a different way. We see the flow. Rooftops become pathways and conduits, possibilities and routes of escape. The flow is what keeps us running, keeps us alive."

### About Me

### Fun Fact
